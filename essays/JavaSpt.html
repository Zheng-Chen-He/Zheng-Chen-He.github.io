  <h2 id="javascript-to-me">JavaScript to me</h2>
<p>I was not entirely new to JavaScript, having taken a coding class in high school that covered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Using these three coding languages to construct my website was quite enjoyable.</p>

<p>In this module, everything feels like a review to me as I havenâ€™t worked with JavaScript for years. However, I find it to be a valuable review. The Free Code Camp has 
not only refreshed many of my memories but has also introduced me to some functions that were not covered in my high school courses. Despite my prior experience with JavaScript, 
I consider it a convenient language to work with, mainly because its functions are first-class.</p>

<h2 id="wods">WODS</h2>
<p>Initially, the prospect of engaging in Workouts of the Day (WODs) this semester filled my mind with a sense of hesitation and reluctance. However, as the semester unfolded,
I found myself developing a genuine appreciation for these WODs. Surprisingly, they evolved into valuable practice tools, offering a hands-on and practical approach to implementing 
JavaScript in real-life scenarios.</p>

<p>Participating in WODs has proven instrumental in honing my coding skills, fostering efficiency, and enhancing problem-solving capabilities. Much like the concept of platforms such as LeetCode, 
the deliberate and consistent practice embedded in WODs serves as a mechanism for maintaining a positive and adaptive mindset in the realm of software development. The iterative nature 
of these exercises cultivates resilience and adaptability, crucial attributes in the dynamic landscape of coding challenges.</p>

<p>Beyond being effective learning tools, WODs have become an enjoyable aspect of my learning journey. The hands-on, problem-solving nature of these exercises adds a dynamic and engaging element 
to the learning process. As I navigate through various coding problems and challenges presented in the WODs, I find myself not only acquiring technical proficiency but also developing a 
sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.</p>

<p>In essence, the initial reluctance I harbored toward WODs has transformed into a genuine fondness for this learning method. The practical, real-world application of JavaScript 
through these exercises has proven to be both enriching and enjoyable, contributing significantly to my growth and competence in software development.</p>
