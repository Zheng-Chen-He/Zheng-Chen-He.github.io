## A smart question
Source: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41095718/run-oracle-scheduler-with-error-ora-20001-this-procedure-must-be-invoked-from"><i class="large github icon "></i>Smart question</a>
A sample model of a smart question is clearly stated in the following way:

Clearly Stated Problem: The question clearly articulates the problem the user is facing, which is receiving an ORA-20001 error when attempting to run the Oracle Scheduler. 
This provides context for potential responders. The question is written in a clear and understandable manner, making it easier for others to comprehend the issue without needing to 
seek additional clarification.

Specific Error Message: The user includes the exact error message (ORA-20001), which is essential for troubleshooting. Specific error messages make it easier for others to pinpoint the issue.
The question is tagged with relevant topics, such as "oracle," "oracle-scheduler," and "plsql." These tags help categorize the question and attract experts in those areas.The user mentions that they are working with Oracle Scheduler, 
indicating the technology stack they are using. This can be crucial information for responders because solutions can vary based on the technology involved.

## A not-so-smart question

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4037939/powershell-says-execution-of-scripts-is-disabled-on-this-system 

Lack of Research: The question appears to be about a common issue in PowerShell where script execution is disabled. The error message itself suggests that scripts are disabled, which is often due to an execution policy. This information is readily available in PowerShell 
documentation, so it might have been beneficial for the user to perform some basic research before posting. The user also does not provide much context or information about their specific environment or what they have already tried. This makes it challenging for potential 
responders to offer targeted solutions. Moreover, The question does not mention any efforts or troubleshooting steps that the user has taken to address the issue. It's helpful to include what you've already tried to solve the problem to avoid getting duplicate or irrelevant answers.
