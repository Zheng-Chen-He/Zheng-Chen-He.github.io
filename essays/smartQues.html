<p>Source: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41095718/run-oracle-scheduler-with-error-ora-20001-this-procedure-must-be-invoked-from"><i class="large github icon"></i>Smart question</a>
A sample model of a smart question is clearly stated in the following way:</p>

<p>Clearly Stated Problem: The question clearly states the problem the user is facing, which is receiving an ORA-20001 error when attempting to run the Oracle Scheduler. 
This question provides the context for potential responders. The question is written in a clear and understandable way, making it easier for others to comprehend the issue without needing to seek for more additional clarification.</p>

<p>Specific Error Message: The user includes the exact error message (ORA-20001), which is essential for troubleshooting. Specific error messages make it easier for others to pinpoint the issue. The question is tagged with relevant topics, such as “oracle,” “oracle-scheduler,” and “plsql.” These tags help categorize the question and attract experts in those areas. The user mentions that they are working with Oracle Scheduler, indicating the technology stack they are using. This can be important information for responders because solutions can be vary based on the technology that is involved.</p>

<h2 id="a-not-so-smart-question">A not-so-smart question</h2>
<p>Source: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4037939/powershell-says-execution-of-scripts-is-disabled-on-this-system "><i class="large github icon "></i>not-so-smart question</a>
A sample model of a not-so-smart question is clearly stated in the following way:</p>

<p>Lack of Research: The question appears to be about a common issue in PowerShell where script execution is disabled. The error message itself suggests that scripts are disabled, which is often due to an execution policy. This information is readily available in PowerShell documentation, so it might have been beneficial for the user to perform some basic research before posting. The user also does not provide much context or information about their specific environment or what they have already tried. This makes it challenging for the responders to offer targeted solutions. Moreover, The question does not mention any efforts or troubleshooting steps that the user has taken to address the issue. It would be very helpful to include what you’ve already tried to solve the problem to avoid getting exactly the same answers.</p>
