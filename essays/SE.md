## Introduction
Coding rules might sound boring, some guidelines on how to write neatly. However, they're super 
important in making computer programs. Imagine them as the rules and the basic fundemental corestone 
of a cool video game that help you create amazing universe on your computer. More over, I've been trying 
out this tool called ESLint with IntelliJ for a week, and I've got some thoughts to share!

## The Scoop on Coding Rules:
Coding rules are like a recipe for writing computer code. They tell you how to organize and write your code so it's 
not messy and confusing. Think of them as the secret ingredient that makes your code look good, work well, and organize.
When everyone follows the same rules, it's like speaking the same language, and that makes it easy for a bunch of people to 
collaborate with each other, makes group work more easier.

## Rules for Learning and My ESLint Adventure:
Here's the cool part: coding rules aren't just for grown-up programmers. They're also your guides when you're learning 
a new computer language. They show you the right way to do things, like a mentor teaching you cool tricks. So, I tried 
using ESLint and IntelliJ for a week. At first, it was a bit tricky because I had to fix some stuff to get a green checkmark. 
It's like learning to ride a bike with training wheels. It might be a bit tough at first, but it helps you become a better coder 
in the end. So, remember, coding rules are like magic spells that make your computer do awesome things, and ESLint and IntelliJ 
are like your trusty wizard's tools on this coding adventure!
