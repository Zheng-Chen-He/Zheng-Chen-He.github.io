## JavaScript to me
JavaScript was not completely new to me. In high school, I took a coding class regarding the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is quite fun using these three coding languages to build your own website.
From this module, Everything is basically a review to me because I haven't touched JavaScript for years. I do think is a great review, the free code camp refreshes many memories and also taught me some functions
I haven't learned from my high school courses. With all my experience with JavaScript, I would consider it a convenient language to work with. It is because its functions are first-class.

## WODS
When I first heard we had to do WODS this semester, my mind was filled with rejections. However, it eventually turns out I do like these WODS. They are good practice tools for you to learn how to implement JavaScript 
in real-life situations. Practicing and doing WODS, makes me become more efficient and adequate in coding problems. It is the same concept as leet code. It is for you to keep your moods in software development.
WODS to me are enjoyable and I do like this learning method.
