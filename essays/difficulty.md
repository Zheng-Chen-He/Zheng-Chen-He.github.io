## Starting interest in electronics

As a generation born in the 21st century, digital devices are tied to early childhood. My first digital device was my grandpa's personal computer that are used for architecture purposes. I soon became attracted to this
small world. Within the small screen, I can chat with people, I can enjoy playing all the video games. It felt like there was another world behind the black LED screen. Through the screen, I became the Alice who traveled into a wonderland. As time passed by, I became curious about all the functions of the small world. So I took a coding class in high school about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At the moment seeing the first website I created, I feel like I became a creator. I am the one who created this piece, and at that time, I decided that in the future, I would be in a field related to computer science. 

## Traveling to the brand new world in digital

Video games are a special and unique word to me, it is not only a game but a different world. It is a world where I can experience everything, I can be a pirate who sails across the oceans, I can be a wizard who goes through an adventure with my team; and I can be a future human driving a gigantic robot in outer space. To me, video games are the essential drive to step into the field of computer science. I loved how I could live a secondary life with all the things I never imagined. Videos games to me, are not just games but arts.

## Computer science, the key to the brand new world

"Any problem in the world can solved or assisted by computer science"

This is the statement I always believed in. With all the technologies we have, things have been much more convenient and solvable. For example, the access to knowledge. Computer science is the essential tool that breaks the information and knowledge barrier. Literally, everything can be searched online. On the other hand, Computer science is an essential tool for almost every job. Physicians, chemists, and biologists need computers for their data and lab experiments; historians and archeologists rely on machines; Artificial intelligence is taking over every field of the liberal arts, including tabletop games, arts, and writing. The future world is all based on computer science

## The road to the future

The world is changing so quickly and frequently with all the new technologies and ideas. The world wouldn't wait for you to slowly catch up. So as A computer science major student. My goal is catch up to the world as quickly as possible, to discover new things and new develops. And a good grade in ICS 314 is fundamental and essential.
