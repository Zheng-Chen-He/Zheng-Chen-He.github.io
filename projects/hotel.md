The fundamental goal of the hotel website is for customers to check if the room of the hotel is still
open or not. It also provides the freedom to add or remove the number of guests enrolling in the hotel.
With that being said, customers do have the ability to cancel or reserve a room as they like.

## Fresh in code
This is my high school project and the first project that I built from scratch with only myself. It is quite difficult in the loneliness and despair when your 
code is not working. Working every night trying to debug. However, it is also this project that leads me to the field of computer science.
