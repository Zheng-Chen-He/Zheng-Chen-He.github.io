Pokemon game is a word-based Pokemon battle game that is based on the famous Nintendo game series Pokemon. In this
project, I inserted some Pokemon data and simulated a fight between them. It compares its attack power, health, and
type the Pokemon have. The essential goal is to defeat the opponent's Pokemon by attacking it until the Pokemon's
health reaches 0
